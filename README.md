# Softmax_Neural_Network

- The current implemantion shows simple 2D data divided into 3 classes:
![Data](Figure_1.png)

- The cost curve for the current single layer implemtaion is:
![Cost Curve](Figure_2.png)

- The decision boundry after training is:
![Decision Boundry](Figure_3.png)


- The current implentaion is as follows:
  **<div align="center">Input -> Linear_layer-> Softmax_layer -> output</div>**
  
- This is implementation is in a computational graph model, thus, fully modular. Any number of layers and and activations can be implemented in any appropriate order
